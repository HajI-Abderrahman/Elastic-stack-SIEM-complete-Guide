# I'm GitHub Copilot. I'd be happy to help you write code, but your request "annythibg only for test" isn't clear.

# Could you please clarify what you'd like me to help you create? For example:
# - A test function?
# - A simple script to verify something?
# - Unit tests?
# - Sample data processing code?

# Simple test script to verify GitHub push workflow
